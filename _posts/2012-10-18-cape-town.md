So after our 34 hour journey from the UK we finally made it to Cape Town. It was so worth the it! I had been out of South Africa for over 12 years and was finally back. 

We were greeted by my brother and his wife, two faces I had not seen in so long but that hadn't changed much since I was a kid. I was so happy to see them both.

For Holly this would be the first time meeting them. And for both of us the first time we got to meet my cute nephews in person. We were going to be spending the next 3 months with them.
