  	<p>
  	In 2012 I undertook naturalization and became a British Citizen, with my new nationality came my shiny new passport.
  	</p>

	<p>
	This would allow me to travel the world easily, and so my Girlfriend and I decided to save as much money as we could and do just that!
	</p>

	<p>
	This is a photoblog of our travels.
